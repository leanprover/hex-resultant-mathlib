# hex-resultant-mathlib (depends on hex-resultant + hex-poly-mathlib + Mathlib)

## Correspondence-only classification

This library is a `correspondence-only-layer`.

Computational conformance owner: `HexResultant`
Computational performance owner: `HexResultant`

Mathlib companion for `hex-resultant`. It proves both the chain-level facts used
for early number-field soundness and the full agreement of the executable
subresultant algorithm with `Polynomial.resultant`.

The full agreement is required. Resultant vanishing proves that a proposed
algebraic value is a root of an eliminant, but tower norms, root-product bounds,
specialization, and Trager factorization also depend on the value of the
resultant, including its units, powers, and signs.

## Headline correctness theorem

`Hex.DensePoly.toPolynomial_resultant`: the executable subresultant
resultant agrees with Mathlib's `Polynomial.resultant` under the
dense-polynomial correspondence, with the executable default formal
degrees (`f.degree?.getD 0`, `g.degree?.getD 0`) made explicit. This is
the end-to-end post-condition of the public API: exact agreement of
values, units, powers, and signs included, not merely simultaneous
vanishing. It needs no monicity, coprimality, or nonzero hypotheses on
`f` and `g`; its typeclass context is the executable algorithm's own
(`CommRing R`, `DecidableEq R`, `Div R`, `Hex.ExactDivLaws R`). It is
built from
`coeffMinor_zero_eq_resultant` through the ordered Brown-Traub chain
correspondence.

The remaining public theorems below are either load-bearing for the
headline proof (the `SubresultantMinor` and `PseudoDivMod` transport
lemmas) or independently justified consumer surface for number-field
soundness (`resultant_eq_zero_iff_common_root`, `eval_resultant`, the
specialization and discriminant facts), per the intermediate-lemma rule
in PLAN/Conventions.md §Headline correctness theorem.

## Public theorems

The exact typeclass assumptions follow the executable algorithm: `R` is a
commutative integral domain with decidable equality, a quotient operation, and
`Hex.ExactDivLaws R`. The `PseudoDivMod` transport theorems are deliberately
more general and need only `[CommRing R] [DecidableEq R]`.

```

The finite sum in `specialize` avoids requiring a Mathlib `CommRing` instance
on `DensePoly R`; the correspondence library intentionally exposes a ring
equivalence without installing that global instance.

Consequently the bivariate specialization theorems are **not** obtained by
instantiating `toPolynomial_resultant` with coefficient type `DensePoly R`.
Instead, the proof gives `DensePoly R` a proof-local Mathlib ring structure,
identifies coefficient evaluation with a ring hom through
`HexPolyMathlib.toPolynomial`, and maps the explicit-degree zeroth coefficient
minor through that hom. `coeffMinorAt_zero_eq_resultant` then identifies the
mapped determinant with the resultant of the specialized inputs. The local
instance never escapes the proof, and the executable correspondence theorem is
not recursively instantiated over `DensePoly R`.

The formal degrees on `eval_resultant` are essential: specialization can erase
a leading coefficient. For example, specializing `t` to zero in `t*y + 1` and
`t*y - 1` drops both degrees; the default-degree resultant of the specialized
constants is not the specialization of the original resultant. Also provide a
default-degree corollary under hypotheses that both leading coefficients remain
nonzero. The one-way vanishing theorem only needs to exclude the case
where both outer formal degrees are zero: under the project convention the
formal-degree `(0, 0)` resultant is `1`, even when both specialized constants
vanish. The vanishing proof maps the default-degree common-root criterion
injectively to the fraction field, promotes the resulting zero back to the
original formal degrees, and uses the positive-formal-degree hypothesis in the
case where both specialized polynomials are zero.

The displayed root-product formula fixes intent rather than Mathlib's final
multiset notation. The implementation uses the pinned revision's existing
`roots` and splitting-field APIs and states the theorem with their actual
multiplicity representation.

## Proof architecture

1. `PseudoDivMod` transports pseudo-division reconstruction, degree bounds, and
   the one-step resultant identity to Mathlib polynomials.
2. The generalized coefficient matrix is identified with Mathlib's Sylvester
   matrix after reversing both axes; the local Laplace determinant is identified
   with `Matrix.det`.
3. The recursive Brown invariant identifies the worker's corrected terminal
   value with the zeroth generalized coefficient minor, including defective
   drops and terminal zero pseudo-remainders.
4. These facts compose to prove `toPolynomial_resultant` for all inputs,
   including zero polynomials, constants, and caller-order swaps.
5. The integer common-root criterion is a corollary of full value
   correspondence and the complex root-product formula.
6. Bivariate specialization maps the explicit-degree coefficient minor through
   coefficient evaluation. This preserves formal degrees even when leading
   coefficients specialize to zero; the default-degree and common-zero results
   follow as corollaries.
7. Mathlib's root-product and discriminant identities then transfer to the
   executable API.

## Downstream contracts

- `hex-number-field-mathlib` lazy arithmetic `_sound` theorems use
  specialization-vanishing.
- Exactification and root completeness use common-root correspondence plus the
  factorization and isolation companions.
- `resultIsolationPrec` for lazy binary arithmetic uses only HexRoots separation
  between roots of one squarefree eliminant.
- `evalDisambiguationPrec` uses the root-product formula to certify a
  nonzero lower bound for wrong root/factor evaluations.
- Tower norms and Trager factor recovery use full agreement and
  specialization.
- Discriminant and squarefree corollaries use discriminant agreement.

The library is verified by building it. Executable conformance remains in
`hex-resultant`.

## External comparators

No external comparator is required.

**Justification:** `correspondence-only-layer` per
`SPEC/benchmarking.md §"Comparator naming"`. The library introduces no
resultant algorithm; it transports and characterises the executable
subresultant chain implemented elsewhere. The computational performance
owner is hex-resultant, where the chain, resultant, and discriminant
bench targets and the FLINT comparator are measured.
